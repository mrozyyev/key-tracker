# User Guidelines - Dorm Key Tracker

## 📋 Essential Rules for Using the App

### 🔑 When Taking the Key

1. **Check Status First**: Always check if the key is available before taking it.
   - If status shows "Available", you can click "I Got the Key"
   - If status shows "Using", someone else has it - join the queue instead
   - **⚠️ CRITICAL: ONLY click "I Got the Key" when you PHYSICALLY HOLD THE KEY in your hand!**
   - Do NOT click this button until you have received the actual key physically

2. **Join the Queue When Key is Taken**: 
   - If someone else is using the key, click "Join Queue" to reserve your spot
   - Your position in the queue will be shown (1st, 2nd, 3rd, etc.)
   - The queue works on a first-come, first-served basis

3. **Check the Queue**: 
   - Always check the "Waiting Queue" section to see if others are waiting
   - Respect the queue order - don't take the key if others are waiting ahead of you

### ✅ When You're Using the Key

1. **Keep the App Open**: 
   - The app auto-refreshes every 30 seconds to show updates
   - Keep your browser tab open or refresh manually to see queue updates

2. **Mark as Available When Done**: 
   - When you're finished using the key, click "Mark as Available"
   - This tells others you're ready to hand it over

3. **Call the Next Person**: 
   - After marking as available, the app will show you who to call next
   - **Call them immediately** - they're waiting!
   - Click the phone number to call them directly from your phone

### 📞 When You're Next in Queue

1. **Wait for the Call**: 
   - If you're next in queue, you'll see a notification: "You're Next in Queue!"
   - Wait for the current holder to call you
   - Answer your phone - they're ready to hand over the key

2. **After Receiving the Key**: 
   - **⚠️ IMPORTANT:** ONLY click "I Got the Key" AFTER you physically have the key in your hand!
   - Do NOT click before receiving the key - this will mark you as the holder incorrectly
   - Once you physically hold the key, click "I Got the Key" to update your status

### 🔄 Queue Management

1. **If No One is Waiting**: 
   - When you mark the key as available and there's no queue, anyone can take it
   - You don't need to wait - just hand it to the next person who needs it

2. **Leaving the Queue**: 
   - If you no longer need the key, click "Leave Queue" 
   - This removes you from the waiting list

3. **Skipping Queue (For Key Holder)**: 
   - If the next person doesn't answer, you can "Skip" them
   - They remain in queue but you can call the next person
   - Use this if someone isn't responding

### ⚠️ Important Reminders

- **Always check the queue** before taking the key when it's available
- **Call immediately** when you mark as available and see someone in queue
- **Be respectful** - follow the queue order
- **Update your status** - always mark as available when done
- **Don't forget** - other people are waiting, so be prompt about handing it off
